# JSONDepth
This program is created to calculate the depth of incoming JSON.
Run the project. It will open the webpage /JSONDepthPage. Type your JSON string  into the textbox and click the button.
The program will calculate the depth of your JSON and return it in such format:  {"levels" : JSONDepth}, where JSONDepth is a depth of your JSON.
There are few unit tests in this project, to check it's workability. They are:
1. DepthCase1 - checks correctness of calculating JSON with depth equal to 1
2. DepthCase4 - checks correctness of calculating JSON with depth equal to 4
3. JSONCaseEmptyInput - checks correctness of working with empty string
4. JSONCaseInvalid - checks correctness of working with invalid JSON
